# vuepress-single-pager
I created this template example to reuse it for my journaling and documentations

[[toc]]

## Getting started
This project was generated by using vuepress

```bash
nvm install --default 20.9.0
npx degit daggerok/vuepress-single-pager nq && cd $_
code . # or: webstorm . # or open with any other IDE / editor...
```

## TBD
Other configurations are skipped because this minimal project would be used as a template...
